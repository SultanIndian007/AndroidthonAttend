## Problem Statement :-

Due to COVID pandemic all colleges have started using digital
medium (zoom and goggle meet) for teaching students. Yet a
major problem of attendance still persists and we like to solve
it using technology. Mobile Application can be used effectively

for their easy access.

Our project 'Attendance Manager app' is used to monitor daily
attendane of FYJC students for the subjects Physics, Chemistry
& Mathematics. Students can view their daily attendance for all
subjects at one go. It is for local use of Thakur College now but
we intend to launch it globally.
